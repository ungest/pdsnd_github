## About The Project
    
### Bike Share Statistics
Over the past decade, bicycle-sharing systems have been growing in number and popularity in cities across the world. Bicycle-sharing systems allow users to rent bicycles on a very short-term basis for a price. This allows people to borrow a bike from point A and return it at point B, though they can also return it to the same location if they'd like to just go for a ride. Regardless, each bike can serve several users per day.
Thanks to the rise in information technologies, it is easy for a user of the system to access a dock within the system to unlock or return bicycles. These technologies also provide a wealth of data that can be used to explore how these bike-sharing systems are used.
This product uses data provided by Motivate, a bike share system provider for many major cities in the United States, to uncover bike share usage patterns. 
It compares the system usage between three large cities: Chicago, New York City, and Washington, DC.

### Built With
Here is a concise list of the tools and libraries I used to build this product.
* [Python](https://www.python.org/)
* [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/index.html)
* [NumPy](https://numpy.org/)
* [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/)


## Getting Started
In order to set up this project to run on your local machine, the user needs to make some installations.

### Prerequisites
* Python 

* pandas
    ```sh
    pip install pandas
* numpy
    ```sh
    pip install numpy


### Installation
1. Download the product 'bikeshare.py'
2. Download the three (3) csv files named 'chicago.csv', 'new_york_city.csv', 'washington.csv' into the same folder as the product file.
3. Install and set up git or an IDE that runs python code like pycharm, Visual Studio Code.
4. open the file on any of the IDEs or use this command on git 'python bikeshare.py'.

## Usage
This products can be used to understand customer behaviour and actions. The informations gotten from this product can leas to effective decision making and enhance customer care and by so doing increase overall profit.
